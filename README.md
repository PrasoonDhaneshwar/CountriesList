## Instructions to run the project
- Make sure to download all the dependencies included in the project.
Since, I've used Android Studio Canary 6 to build the project, it is required to have **Android Gradle Plugin version 8.0.0** or above.

- You can directly run the app by installing the apk named "countries-list-1.0.0-debug.apk" in "output" folder.

## Notes and Implementation Details
- **Architecture pattern decision.** I chose MVVM architecture with use cases and used a multi-module approach for better scalability, testability, and separation of concerns. 
- I used typical libraries such as Coil for image loading, Hilt for DI, Jetpack Navigation for navigating and passing data between screens
- Testing strategy and coverage details. Both UI and unit tests have been covered with 100% coverage for unit tests. Check folder "coverageReport" for more details.

# Trade-offs #
- Since, it's a limited list of countries, it can further be improved by using a database to cache the data.
- Used two separate viewmodels for currency and exchange. A Shared ViewModel could also be used by maintaining and passing an ID of the "Country" instead of a big Json "Country" string, which I've used in the project. Since it's a limited and fixed list of countries, I chose this approach.
